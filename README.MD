# PICO
Pico is a toy chess engine I decided to write to learn C++ again. I was pretty good (at least IMO) at that language in the 90, but now I want to approach it in a new manner, especially by the added value of having had a wide experience in other frameworks and tools.
As well as having experience in th elanguage, I had experience in chess engines as well, but using C#. At the very end I did not obtain a real engine, but just some tool able to comppute valid move in a certain position.
I think that could be useful to someone, and to this project as well, so I share a [link to it](https://github.com/FelicePollano/Felpo-II).
